		"message": "The Tang Dynasty of China reigned from about 618 AD to 907 AD. Established by the Li family, the dynasty ruled from the capital city at Chang'an. The era was a largely peaceful one after many years of rebellion, civil wars, and chaos. Chinese poetry had entered its golden era and Buddhism grew increasingly influential. Except for an interruption by Empress Wu Zetian, China's only woman regent, who ruled from 690 AD to 705 AD, the dynasty's rule was a period of undisturbed peace."

		"title": "Renaissance",
		"message": "The Italian Renaissance began around 1400, causing a major cultural shift with emphasis on art and science, and important artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci emerged. The Age of Exploration and Discovery had begun, and explorers were sent from many countries, especially by the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and British. The Protestant Reformation began around 1517 with Martin Luther publishing the Ninety-five Theses, beginning a period of church reform that would last until 1648. The Thirty Years War lasted from 1618 to 1648, sparked by the religious division of Germany and ending with the Peace of Westphalia. There was also a scientific revolution beginning around the 16th century with major advancements in science made by Copernicus, Galileo, and Isaac Newton. This was followed by the Age of Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, which truly transformed the continent. France had emerged as a powerful nation, and the French Revolution in 1789 set off a new model of government, with other nations following suit with the European Revolutions in 1848. Many changes subsequently occurred, including the formation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1867, and the unification of Germany and of Italy in 1871."
